    I think this is sensible to merge, since it does not affect the workings of the package and it removes some confusion, so merging
  * Remove non-functional doPoseEstimation from fiducial_slam
  * Remove unused subscriber
  * Merge pull request #221 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/221> from UbiquityRobotics/bugfix-#220 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/bugfix-/issues/220>
    Allow covariance to be overridden by launch file
  * Allow covariance to be overriden by launch file
    Uses YAML interpretation for the parameter so that it becomes an array
    instead of a string. Fix a comparison issue in the code to make the
    override actually warn on 0 values.
  * Return early from auto init when no fiducials
  * Merge pull request #214 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/214> from UbiquityRobotics/publish_fids

    Cleanup for fiducial_slam
  * add and run clang-format
  * Get rid of observation.positon, it was only being used in 1 place
  * Links to other fiducials uses set instead map<int,int>
    We only care if the element exists or not, so a set is a
    clearer data structure to use.
  * Unused sum_in_qudrature removed, holdover from Alexy stuff
  * Use clearer ranged for where possible
    Ranged for provides an easier way to interate over every
    element in a containter.
    NOTE: This commit changes what I consider to be buggy behavior
    in the autoInit and findClosestObs code, which was not properly
    iterating over every elemnent, using obs[0] every time.
  * Remove using namespace declarations
    These are generally considered dangerous, due to the potential
    for namespace collisions and unclarity when using types.

  * Merge pull request #112 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/112> from UbiquityRobotics/davecrawley-patch-1
    Added in a systematic error parameter
  * fix missed rename alexy to sum in quadrature
  * Suggested changes
  * Updating the launch file to match the changes to map.cpp
  * Added in a systematic error parameter
    Added in a systematic error parameter. This parameter is intended to take in to account systematic (non-random) errors in the measurement of fiducial position. Non-random errors can be very pernicious, and can generate highly unexpected and difficult to resolve issues. For example if **all** the fiducials are slightly the wrong size this will not show up as a random variance. Similar systematic errors include, camera mis-calibration, sampling defects, digitization errors, lens flaring and so forth. Measurement accuracy in-homogeneity can also be considered a systematic error and this will also help with that issue although it probably should be treated explicitly rather than through this "hack". Ultimately the correct approach is to rigorously compute all these systematic errors and add them in to the model - we are simply saying that we think the systematic errors are less than the specified value.
