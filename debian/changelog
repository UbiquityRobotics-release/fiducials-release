ros-melodic-fiducial-slam (0.11.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Compatibilty with Melodic, remove opencv3 dependancy
    opencv3 is no longer a package in melodic, so we use cv_bridge
    to get the correct opencv transitively
  * New fusion with planar-based error estimation
    * Estimate variance of fiducial obsevations based on how well they place the robot on the floor upright
    * use Kalman + David method of fusing estimates
    * split out Transform with Variance, do some cleanup
    * Simple unit tests for core fusion code
    * remove hokey outlier rejection
  * Add support for overriding covariance diagonal
  * Add fiducial transform array stamp (#156 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/156>)
  * Add publish_tf rosparam functionality and updated launch file accordingly (#154 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/154>)
    * Added publish_tf rosparam to disable publishing pose tf
    * Change default publish_tf to True and fix 'if' formatting

ros-melodic-fiducial-slam (0.9.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #112 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/112> from UbiquityRobotics/davecrawley-patch-1
    Added in a systematic error parameter
  * fix missed rename alexy to sum in quadrature
  * Suggested changes
  * Updating the launch file to match the changes to map.cpp
  * Added in a systematic error parameter
    Added in a systematic error parameter. This parameter is intended to take in to account systematic (non-random) errors in the measurement of fiducial position. Non-random errors can be very pernicious, and can generate highly unexpected and difficult to resolve issues. For example if **all** the fiducials are slightly the wrong size this will not show up as a random variance. Similar systematic errors include, camera mis-calibration, sampling defects, digitization errors, lens flaring and so forth. Measurement accuracy in-homogeneity can also be considered a systematic error and this will also help with that issue although it probably should be treated explicitly rather than through this "hack". Ultimately the correct approach is to rigorously compute all these systematic errors and add them in to the model - we are simply saying that we think the systematic errors are less than the specified value.
